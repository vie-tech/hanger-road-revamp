            <h3>Storage Tank Inspection</h3>
            <p>
              With a combination of highly skilled personnel and a UT robotic
              tank floor inspection system, HRI in exclusive partnership with
              his foreign partner provides API 653-compliant online inspection
              of above ground storage tanks without the risk, cost, or hassle of
              removing tanks from service. <br /> Our partners Short Range Wave
              Ultrasonic Testing (SRUT) is specifically designed to screen
              difficult-to-access locations of tanks, vessels such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Areas underneath support, clamps, and composite repairs</li>
              <li>The annular plate of above ground storage tanks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Our testing equipment produces a high-resolution, real-time color
              image of internal/external corrosion up to four feet from the
              transducer.
